# Yahoo-Calendar-Web-Scraper

This a work in progress. I have currently been able to scrape the Yahoo Finance Calendar for Earnings Reports being released the following day under a specified price range. I have also begun building the GUI, which I have already sketched out and designed. This is all a learning process for me as I have had to learn how to use Beautiful Soup (to web scrape) and tkinter (to build the GUI). 

The web scraper will allow the user to select a specific event: earnings report release, stock split or IPO. The user will then be able to specify certain conditions to filter through the companies releasing the event the following day. The current planned conditions will be to filter based on: price, volume, average volume and float. I have no doubt more conditions will be added to allow the user to customize their scan to their specific desire. 

The user will be able to add as many conditions as they would like, as many as there are conditions. The GUI will have a condition box where the user can add or delete conditions. The condition box will be made up of condition rows that each has a drop down menu to select a condition, and each row will have a min and max input field to filter their condition. 

Though this is all new to me, I am excited about the learning process. There have definetely been frustrating moments, but the satisfaction of finally making something work is worth the while.
