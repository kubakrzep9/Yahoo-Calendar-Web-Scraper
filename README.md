# Yahoo-Calendar-Web-Scraper

This a work in progress. I have currently been able to scrape the Yahoo Finance Calendar for Earnings Reports being released the following day under a specified price range. I have also begun building the GUI, which I have already sketched out and designed. This is all a learning process for me as I have had to learn how to use Beautiful Soup (to web scrape) and tkinter (to build the GUI).
